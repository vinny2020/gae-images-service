this folder (docs) contains the text file documentation.
example_xml contains sample xml for the complex transformations
I also included an image you can use with curl to replicate my curl commands in the docs.
At the project root is a test directory. They contain unit tests wriiten in groovy that use junit.
All the required libraries for testing are in the "testlib" folder
Remember that in order to to use the BlobStore, Google requires that billing be enabled.
Like I said before, I'll be available for support of the app for about a month so feel free to contact me with any problems.
