Workflow for creating new stored images using the REST API



The Simple Web Service API is based on 3 separate calls to the underlying API. Goal was to keep it simple
and concise.

format:
{METHOD}  URI
[BODY content]


1. create upload an image:

POST /image/new 
[ binary data consistent  with the parameters of an upload form] 


RESPONSE: get back a permanent a unique "imageKey" identifier in the response BODY [imageKey String]

use this imageKey for future operations, transformations or retrieval



2.  Transform an image:

Simple transfromations will have parameters in the url while advanced operation use PUT to upload XML files

PUT "/george/image/transform/${imageKey}"
[ an array of  desired transformations and their parameters]


RESPONSE: get back a new permanent URL for the transformed image  [imageKey String]



3. Retrieve Image: a simple get at the url below will get the binary image, works for all stored images, original and transformed

>>
GET "/george/image/${imageKey}" 

<< binary image file
