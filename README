This is an API for using the Google App Engine Image manipulation API.
I hope people find it useful. To store images, GAE requires that you enable billing 
to use the BlobStore. As of the time of this writing, the BlobStore can hold as much as 2M and 
ULRFetch requests are limited to 1Mb and 30 seconds. Please visit the docs to see what the current limitations are.
